#These "type hints" are a special syntax that allow declaring the type of a variable.
Converts the first letter of each one to upper case with title().

#Generic types with type parameters¶
""" There are some data structures that can contain other values, like dict, list, 
set and tuple. And the internal values can have their own type too.

example, let's define a variable to be a list of str. """

""" From typing, import List (with a capital L): """

""" from typing import List


def process_items(items: List[str]):
    for item in items:
        print(item) """


Predefined values¶

If you have a path operation that receives a path parameter, but you want the possible valid path 
parameter values to be predefined, you can use a standard Python Enum.
Create an Enum class¶

Import Enum and create a sub-class that inherits from str and from Enum.

By inheriting from str the API docs will be able to know that the values must be of 
type string and will be able to render correctly.

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

fake_items_db = [{"item_name": "Foo"}, {"item_name": "Bar"}, {"item_name": "Baz"}]


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_item(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):
    return fake_items_db[skip : skip + limit]
